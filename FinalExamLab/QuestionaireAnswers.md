## Spatial Data Structures Final Exam
Fall 2015


### Lastly Fill Out the Questionnaire below:

You must complete the questionnaire, or I won't grade your exam.

Remember this was my first attempt at teaching this class, so your not gonna hurt my feelings. Not that you
worry about that anyway! Give feedback please.

 1. Was python a good language for this course? Would you like to use another, or a mix?

 ```
 Answer: I rather enjoy python so this was a fun way to brush up on my skills. The language may have limited
 our ability to do the map tile project but I'm sure you'll come up with a better suited project by next time.


 ```



 2. Should I have concentrated more on the "data structures" and less on writing programs to use the structures? Meaning should I have made an attempt to add to the 4 main structures we covered.

  ```
 Answer: Hindsight the 4th data structure would have probably been easier to cover and handy to know. I still prefer what we attempted to do as it was more fun and less reading all the time.
 We lost a lot of time due to delays in trying to solve the tile project but once those are gone you could probably fit the 4th structure in as well as have a fun project.

 ```



 3. Were there enough? Or not enough programs for the semester?


  ```
 Answer:
 6 programs is about as much as other classes give. So 6 is good just more spread out over the semester.

 ```



 4. I already now I should grade programs faster so you don't need to comment on that. I also know my knowledge of the subject matter could be better. I plan on working on both.

  ```
 Answer:


 ```



 5. Did you turn in all your programs? If not why, and how many did you get working?


  ```
 Answer: Quite sure I turned in all of my programs unless I misfiled a name somewhere.


 ```



 6. What is your assumed grade in this course? Meaning based on what you completed, what do you think you earned.


  ```
 Answer: Probably an A. I earned most likely a B since I procrastinated quite a few projects that could have used a bit more love.


 ```



 7. Is this the same, or different than what you thought your grade would be at the start of the semester?

 ```
 Answer: A bit better. Very early in the semester I had issues trying to have any good interactions with you. I don't blame anyone in particular just how the situations
came about each time we met. Then starting off with 3 research papers had me thinking the class would leave us elbow deep in papers and research. Luckily the former solved itself as class went along and the latter turned out to be entirely different than what it appeared..
